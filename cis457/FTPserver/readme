These Python 3.6 scripts enable an FTP file transfer of a text file.
This project requires that the server and client scripts run in different directories so their file streams to the file system do not interfere.


ftp_server is a multithreaded server that responds to commands given by the client(s).
This script should be run in its own directory.
The script can be executed by terminal:  python3 ftp_server.py



ftp_client is a client that accepts commands from the user and transmits them to the server.
This script should be run in its own directory.
The script can be executed by terminal:  python3 ftp_client.py
