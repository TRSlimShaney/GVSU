I'm impressed you got the two-player version working.  (As far as I know, you are the only one who attempted it.)
The flow of the game is still confusing. (You really need to display two different boards, and and a field giving explaining why a roll isn't allowed when the roll button does nothing.)  But, still an impressive effort.

A couple of minor details:
* You should show the number of "-5" taken
* Score is based on the *number* of x's, not their location.
